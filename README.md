# Spectral Reflectance-based Heart Rate Estimation from Facial Video (ICIP 2019)

<p align="justify">
Standard techniques to determine HR involve physical contact and
are inconvenient for the user. We propose a novel HR measurement framework which consists of
a feature point recovery system and a spectral reflectance-based
illumination rectification approach to deal with motion and
illumination interferences respectively. Our illumination
rectification approach is independent of the background and
produces excellent results even when the foreground and
background have different illumination sources, unlike previous
papers which have utilized the mean pixel intensity of the
background to neutralize changes in illumination.
